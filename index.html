    <div>
        <h2>Heading2:Lets create the folder D1</h2>
        <p>Essentially I have two FiveM servers. One is a test and one is my live. I want to be able to utilize VScode when using my github. When commiting and syncing changes for my test server. I got that, but what I want to do is when anytime I commit/sync from my test, I want it to move over to my Live server. </p>

        <h3>heading3:some examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>creat in local</li>
            <li>creat in git</li>
            <li>use git cmmands</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Heading4:Try some more D2</h4>
        <p>I've had it like this before, I just don't know how to sync these two servers together. Again, I have the portion down of committing and syncing with my test server. How do I make this also reflect on my live server.</p>
